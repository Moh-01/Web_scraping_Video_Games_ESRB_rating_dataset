# Acknowledgment
- This data has been collected from [ESRB official website](https://www.esrb.org/).
- Rating explanation referenced to [IGN official website](https://www.ign.com/) and [ESRB official website](https://www.esrb.org/).
- This data has been collected for educational purposes and not for any other use.

# **Overview**
- This data contains the name for `1895 games` with `34 of ESRB rating content` as features for each game.<br>
- Also a test data with 500 games (Obserrvation) labeld.<br>
- A single datapoint is represented as a single number form `0-3` for `Console` and a `binary vector` for the `features of ESRB content`.

# **What is about?**

## Problem Statement
- Many parents are giving their children any game to play without thinking about what's the content of that game or what's the target age for it. and this is affecting the children specifically, because many games are not made for kids, either because of sexual content, drugs, and/or violence.
- ESRB works to empower parents to make informed decisions about the video games they purchase for their children and allow them to be played in their homes.
- The ESRB doesnâ€™t aim to prohibit certain games from being purchased and played but rather hopes to provide concise and impartial information to parents and other consumers.

- ESRB rating: An assigned rating category that suggests the age-appropriateness of that particular game
